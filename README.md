The Plan
===

The plan is to split the terminal into two halves. One half holds the current
buffer, while the other half holds the message and output log.

```nim
+------------------------- nimREPL version 0.1.0 -----------------------------+
|34 >for i in range[0..3]:                                                    |
|35 >  echo "hello"                                                           |
|36 >let b = 3                                                                |
|>>>>proc doSomethingWith[U](b: int, fn: int->U): U =                         |
|>>>>  if b == high(T):                                                       |
|>>>>    echo $b, " is high(int)."                                            |
|>>>>    try:                                                                 |
|>>>>      return b.fn()                                                      |
|>>>>    except:                                                              |
|>>>>      echo "Something unexpected happened!"                              |
|>>>>      raise: # pass on the error                                         |
|>>>>  else:                                                                  |

|> hello                                                                      |

```

Typing something into the `>>>>` prompt adds it to the buffer. If there is no
indentation and no assignment for a noSideEffect declared function,
instead of being discarded: it is evaluated and outputted to the log.

The sourceFile is loaded into the top of the buffer.

Commands start with `:`, there is syntax highlighting based on if a command
exists. Some commands include:
+ :quit, :q     -> quit nimRepl
+ :help, :h, :? -> see commands
+ :load, :l     -> load a source file into the buffer

There is syntax highlighting based on a reserved keywords list, numbers,
and primitive types.

The last line of the buffer will be named the "Command Line". It is here that
you can type commands and simple evaluations. It is shown without a line
number. If there is no command and no evaluation, this line is added to the
end of the buffer upon pressing enter. The commandline can grow for complex
statements.

For now, long lines will be trimmed, and have to be shown by placing the cursor
to the end of the screen.
